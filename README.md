 way to have the computer speak out the names of the Arabic letters. This is useful for situations where a person is learning the Arabic alphabet or cannot use their own voice.

## About the audio:
I recorded the audio on April 13th, 2022.
I used the names of the letters with case endings (i.e. tanwiin) because it is easier for beginners to hear in that case. The extra "-un" endings are optional in the pronunciaton of the names of the Arabic letters.
